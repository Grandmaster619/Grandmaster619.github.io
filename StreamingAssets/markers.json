      "mainData": "Studying the asteroid Psyche could reveal clues about the origins of Earth and our solar system, as it may be a remnant of an early rocky planet. Its unusual features might even surprise scientists and reshape our understanding of how solar system objects form.",

      "mainData": "Psyche has an irregular, potato-like shape. However, if Psyche were a perfect sphere, it would have a diameter of 140 miles (226 kilometers), or about the length of the State of Massachusetts (leaving out Cape Cod).",

      "name": "Marker 3 Pop Up #3",
      "mainData": "Psyche is most likely a survivor of multiple violent hit-and-run collisions, common when the solar system was forming. Thus, Psyche may be able to tell us how Earth’s core and the cores of the other rocky, or terrestrial, planets came to be.",

      "name": "Marker 3 Pop Up #4",
      "mainData": "Psyche was the 16th asteroid to ever be discovered! Psyche was found in 1852 by Italian astronomer Annibale de Gasparis, who named it for the goddess of the soul in ancient Greek mythology who is often depicted as a butterfly-winged female figure.",

      "name": "Marker 3 Pop Up #5",
      "mainData": "Recent data indicates that the asteroid is possibly a mix of metal and silicate, the same material found in glass and sand. The best analysis indicates that Psyche is likely made of a mixture of rock and metal, with metal composing 30% to 60% of its volume.",

      "mainData": "Psyche is dense, estimated at about 212 to 256 pounds per cubic foot (3,400 to 4,100 kilograms per cubic meter). The surface gravity on Psyche is much less than it is on Earth, even less than it is on Earth’s Moon. On Psyche, lifting a car would feel like lifting a large dog.",

      "name": "Marker 4 Pop Up #1",
      "mainData": "The Psyche Spacecraft’s Multispectral Imager is equipped with two identical high-resolution cameras, which will be used to take the first pictures of the Psyche Asteroid. These images will be used to create a topographical map of the surface of Psyche, charting craters, hills, valleys, and other geological features that can provide insight into its history. 7 different near-infrared filters allow the imager to isolate different spectral wavelengths, enabling the imager to determine what types of minerals are on the surface. Additionally, the Multispectral Imager is used as a navigational tool for the Psyche Spacecraft. Similar to a sextant used to navigate oceans in the 18th century, the imager takes pictures of star fields and celestial bodies to determine the position and orientation of the craft.",

      "mainData": "Psyche’s magnetometer will look for evidence of an ancient magnetic field at the asteroid Psyche. A residual magnetic field would be strong evidence the asteroid formed from the core of a planetary body.",

      "mainData": "The Psyche science team will harness the telecommunications system, used to send commands to and receive data from the spacecraft, to conduct gravity science also. By analyzing the radio waves the spacecraft communicates with, scientists can measure how the asteroid Psyche affects the spacecraft’s orbit. From that information, scientists can determine the asteroid’s rotation, mass, and gravity field, gaining additional insights into the composition and structure of the asteroid’s interior.",
